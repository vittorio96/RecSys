    Randomly split interactions between training and testing.

    This function takes an interaction set and splits it into
    two disjoint sets, a training set and a test set. Note that
    no effort is made to make sure that all items and users with
    interactions in the test set also have interactions in the
    training set; this may lead to a partial cold-start problem
    in the test set.

    Parameters
    ----------

    interactions: a scipy sparse matrix containing interactions
        The interactions to split.
    test_percentage: float, optional
        The fraction of interactions to place in the test set.
    random_state: np.random.RandomState, optional
        The random state used for the shuffle.

    Returns
